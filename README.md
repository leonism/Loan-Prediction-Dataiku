# Dataiku Version of Kaggle's Load Prediction Challenge

Welcome to the Dataiku version of the Kaggle's Load Prediction Challenge! In this repository, we present a Dataiku-centric approach to tackling the Load Prediction Challenge, a popular machine learning competition hosted on Kaggle. This challenge revolves around predicting the load demand of electricity consumers based on various features such as time, weather conditions, and historical load data.

## What is Dataiku?

Dataiku is a leading AI and machine learning platform that empowers organizations to collaboratively build, deploy, and manage data science solutions at scale. With its intuitive interface and powerful features, Dataiku streamlines the entire data science workflow, from data preparation and exploration to model development and deployment.

## Overview of the Challenge

The Load Prediction Challenge on Kaggle provides participants with a dataset containing historical load data, weather information, and other relevant features. The goal is to develop machine learning models that accurately forecast the load demand for future time periods, enabling utilities and energy providers to better plan and manage their resources.

## Approach with Dataiku

In this repository, we leverage the capabilities of Dataiku to preprocess the dataset, engineer meaningful features, and train predictive models for load prediction. Dataiku's visual interface and collaborative environment make it easy for data scientists and analysts to work together, experiment with different modeling techniques, and iterate on solutions efficiently.
