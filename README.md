# Installation
On this repository, you may find my personal projects related to Machine Learning, EDA, Python Jupyter Notebook and couple of Visualization based on the Dataiku Platform exported standard files. Most of the datasets I've been working with, downloaded from Kaggle. Installation pretty straight forward. Simply download the whole set as a single project and as a ZIP files, everything have been flattened out with plain text files, and no SQL dump was involved, so there wouldn't be any missing system dependencies issue. Simply imported the downloaded Zip file to your working project.

And please remember, as this is only a weekend pet project, which I'm doing them for my personal interest only.
